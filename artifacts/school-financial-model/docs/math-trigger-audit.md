# Math-Trigger Audit (Task #318)

**Goal.** Catalogue every "logic-tree trigger" in the SchoolStack Budget wizard
where founder selections (state, entity type, school stage, funding profile,
etc.) drive the underlying math, and document the integrity status of each one
after the Task #318 fixes (F1, F2, F3) land.

**Scope.** This audit covers the React wizard steps under
`src/pages/model-wizard/steps/`, the canonical defaults under `src/lib/`, and
the shared engine under `lib/finance/src/decision-engine/`. The API mirror in
`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/consultant-engine.ts` is treated as a downstream
parity target.

> Glossary
> - **Trigger** = a profile field whose value changes the *numbers*, not just
>   labels or copy.
> - **Driver** = the engine code that consumes the resulting state. Most live
>   in `scenario-engine.ts` (UI, golden-frozen) and `consultant-engine.ts`
>   (API mirror, parity-tested).

## 2. Concrete fixes shipped in Task #318

### F1 — SUTA / FICA wage-base caps

**Symptom.** Founders saw an over-stated payroll-tax line for any salary that
exceeded a state's SUI taxable wage base. The engine multiplied the *full*
salary by a flat blended percent (e.g. WA → 9.95%), so a $200k Head of School
showed ~$19,900 in payroll tax versus the actually-owed ~$16,041 — a 24%
overstatement on that row.

**Root cause.** `STATE_PAYROLL_TAX_MAP` exposed only a single blended `rate`,
with no notion of per-component wage-base caps (FICA-OASDI $176,100, FUTA $7k,
SUI varies $7k–$176,100 by state, PFML/comp varies).

**Fix.**
1. `state-payroll-tax-data.ts` — every state component now carries an optional
   `wageBase: number`; FICA-OASDI, FUTA, every state SUI/PFML/comp entry is
   populated with the 2025 base. Federal-uncapped components (Medicare) leave
   `wageBase` undefined.
2. New helpers `computePayrollTaxForSalary(salary, components)` and
   `computeEffectivePayrollTaxRate(salary, components)` apply the per-component
   cap.
3. `model-shape.ts` (engine) — `StaffingRowLike.payrollTaxComponents?` added so
   the engine can use the cap-aware path. `StaffingRowData` and
   `staffingRowSchema` mirror the field.
4. `lib/finance/.../scenario-engine.ts` and
   `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/consultant-engine.ts` now call
   `computePayrollTaxForSalary` per-FTE when components are present and the
   user has *not* manually overridden the row's blended rate. This preserves
   user intent (manual override wins) while giving the default the correct
   shape.
5. `staffing-defaults.ts` (`generateDefaultStaffingRows`,
   `createBlankStaffRow`, `calculatePersonnelCosts`) thread an optional
   `stateCode` and seed components + a salary-blended `payrollTaxRate` so
   existing UI and downstream readers see a sensible number.
6. `StaffingStep.tsx` reads `schoolProfile.state` and threads it through.

**Engine parity.** Backward-compatible: existing fixtures don't set
`payrollTaxComponents`, so the engine falls back to the flat-rate path and
golden snapshots remain frozen. Parity tests pass without regen.

**Tests.** `math-trigger-fixes.test.ts → F1` (8 cases) covers wage-base
arithmetic, zero-salary edge cases, low-vs-high-earner effective rates, and
51-jurisdiction coverage.

### F2 — ESA / voucher per-student amount auto-fill on manual add

**Symptom.** When a founder clicked "Add line item" inside the ESA / voucher
or tax-credit block on the Revenue step, the new row arrived with `amounts:
[0,0,…]`. To get the right number they had to flip back to the state-data
modal or hand-key the per-student amount — easy to skip, easy to under- or
over-state.

**Root cause.** `addLineItem(category)` in `RevenueStep.tsx` instantiated rows
with hard-coded zeros and no `note`, even when the surrounding category had a
known `programId` from `state-funding-data`.

**Fix.** `RevenueStep.tsx → addLineItem` now resolves the matched
`ProgramInfo` for the current `(state, programId)` and pre-fills `amounts`
using `Math.round((min + max) / 2)` plus an explanatory `note` of the form
*"From {state} program data — typical $X–$Y/student."* The behaviour is
identical to the modal-driven add path, removing a silent zero-default
foot-gun.

**Tests.** Covered by the existing `state-funding-data.test.ts` (program-data
shape) plus integration via `decision-flows.test.ts` (revenue rows render with
non-zero defaults under state context).

### F3 — State business registration & annual report fees

**Symptom.** The Expense step never surfaced state-level entity costs. CA LLCs
quietly owe the $800 minimum franchise tax every year; DE C-corps owe $50 +
franchise tax; NY LLCs hit the one-time publication fee in Y1. None of this
existed in the chart of accounts, so founders modeled $0 for a recurring,
non-trivial cost.

**Fix.**
1. `src/lib/state-entity-fees.ts` — new 51-jurisdiction × 5-entity-type table
   covering `llc_single`, `llc_partnership`, `c_corp`, `s_corp`, and
   `nonprofit_501c3`. Each cell carries `annual` (recurring), optional
   `oneTimeY1` (initial filing / publication), and a `notes` field that
   explains the rate so founders see the citation in-row.
   Helpers: `getStateEntityFeeProfile(stateCode, entityType)` returns null for
   `sole_practitioner` / `undetermined` / unknown states; `buildEntityFeeAmounts`
   distributes `oneTimeY1` to year 1 and the annual fee across years 1..N.
2. `expense-defaults.ts → generateDefaultExpenseRows(...)` accepts an
   `entityFeeContext?: { stateCode, entityType }` and appends a single
   `State Entity Filing Fees` row (id `state_entity_filing_fees`, category
   `administrative_general`, driver `annual_fixed`, enabled by default) when
   the founder has answered both questions and the entity type is in scope.
3. `ExpenseStep.tsx` reads `schoolProfile.state` and `schoolProfile.entityType`,
   passes them into the defaults, and runs a reactive `useEffect` that
   re-syncs (or removes) the entity-fee row whenever either field changes
   after first init.

**Tests.** `math-trigger-fixes.test.ts → F3` (10 cases) covers 51-state
coverage, the 5-entity-type matrix, null fall-throughs for
sole-practitioner/undetermined/unknown-state, the CA $800 spot-check,
year-1 vs. recurring distribution in `buildEntityFeeAmounts`, and the
defaults-row emission/omission paths.

## 3. Items intentionally out of scope

- **Local & city business licenses** (e.g. Seattle B&O tax, NYC commercial
  rent tax, San Francisco gross receipts). ~~Too address-specific to seed
  sensibly without the founder's exact municipality.~~ **Closed by Task #321
  (F4)** — surfaced as a founder-driven opt-in row in Business Operations
  with a curated list of common municipal charges and a free-text annual
  amount. The row is canonical (`Local / City Business License`,
  account code `8616`, `administrative_general`), so it inherits the same
  general-cost-inflation escalation as other annual-fixed admin items.
- **Federal income / unrelated business income tax**. Already covered (or
  intentionally excluded) by the existing tax block — out of Task #318's
  scope.
- **Workers' comp by occupation class**. Today modeled as a flat per-state
  rate; class-code refinement is tracked separately.
- **Repo-wide typecheck failure in `artifacts/budget-allhands`**. Pre-existing
  on `main`, not introduced by Task #318.

### F4 — Local / city business license opt-in row (Task #321)

**Symptom.** F3 closed state-level entity fees but explicitly punted on
city/county licensing. Founders in Seattle (B&O), NYC (commercial rent tax),
San Francisco (gross receipts), and many smaller jurisdictions had no place
to model a recurring municipal cost that can run anywhere from $50/yr to
several thousand a year.

**Fix.**
1. `expense-defaults.ts` — added a canonical `Local / City Business License`
   line item (id `local_business_license`, account code `8616`) under
   `administrative_general` with `defaultAmount: 0` and `enabledFor: []`. It
   uses the `annual_fixed` driver so it inherits `generalCostInflation` like
   the rest of the admin block. Exported `LOCAL_BUSINESS_LICENSE_LINE_ITEM`
   for downstream consumers.
2. `schema.ts` — added optional `hasLocalBusinessLicense: boolean` and
   `localBusinessLicenseAnnualCost: number` to `schoolProfileSchema`,
   defaulting to `false` / `0` so existing models migrate cleanly.
3. `ExpenseStep.tsx` — added a `BusinessOperationsToggle` in the Business
   Operations card with a curated help blurb (Seattle B&O, NYC commercial
   rent tax, SF gross receipts, plus the typical $50–$500/yr flat-license
   range). The reactive `useEffect` mirrors the bookkeeper / lawyer /
   liability-insurance pattern: when the toggle flips or the amount changes,
   the canonical row's `enabled` and `amounts` are re-derived via
   `computeEscalatedAmounts` so the escalation behavior stays consistent.

**Why this is opt-in.** Unlike state filing fees (deterministic from
`state` + `entityType`), municipal rates are address-specific — even
neighboring zip codes can land in different tax jurisdictions. A founder
toggle plus a free-text amount is the lowest-friction way to keep the
expense visible without seeding misleading numbers from `state` alone.

### F4a — Curated city starter for Local / City Business License (Task #325)

**Symptom.** F4 made the toggle visible but every founder still started
from $0. Founders in cities where a license really IS required for
schools had no easy way to see "the typical small-school number for *my*
city is around $X" — they had to research the rate themselves before
they could even sanity-check the budget.

**Accuracy guardrail.** Most US cities and states do NOT require a
general business license for a small private school. Many municipal
business taxes (B&O, gross receipts, business income) statutorily exempt
educational institutions and/or 501(c)(3) nonprofits, and many flat
license fees either don't apply to schools or are $0 for them. Seeding
a non-zero amount in those cities would plant a recurring expense the
founder doesn't actually owe. The table is therefore deliberately tiny
and we under-suggest rather than over-suggest.

**Fix.**
1. `schema.ts` — added an optional `city` (string) on `schoolProfileSchema`
   right next to `state`. Free text so any city is allowed.
2. `SchoolProfileStep.tsx` — added a `FormInput` for "City / Municipality
   (optional)" beside the State picker, with a helperText that's honest
   that most cities don't need a license and only names the few that do.
3. `src/lib/local-business-license-data.ts` — new curated table covering
   only the jurisdictions where a license/registration fee genuinely
   applies to a small operating school (for-profit or nonprofit) and the
   rate is publicly documented:
   - **Washington DC** ($300/yr equivalent) — DC Basic Business License
     is mandatory for private schools.
   - **Seattle WA** ($110/yr) — Business License Tax Certificate is
     required for everyone operating in Seattle.
   - **San Francisco CA** ($100/yr) — Business Registration Certificate
     is required for all businesses including nonprofits.
   - **Los Angeles CA** ($153/yr) — Business Tax Registration
     Certificate; nonprofits can apply for an exemption but must still
     register.

   Each profile carries `suggestedAnnual` (conservative for a small
   school) and `basisNote` (a citation pointing to the city's own
   licensing program). Cities like NYC, Chicago, Philadelphia, Portland,
   Denver, Tacoma — which appeared on an earlier draft — were dropped
   because either (a) they don't require a general business license for
   schools, (b) educational nonprofits are statutorily exempt, or (c)
   the charge is actually a per-employee tax that lives in payroll, not
   a flat license fee. Lookup helper
   `getLocalBusinessLicenseProfile(state, city)` is case-insensitive and
   trim-tolerant.
4. `ExpenseStep.tsx` — when the founder toggles **Local / City Business
   License** ON and `(state, city)` matches a curated profile, the
   Annual cost field is pre-filled with `suggestedAnnual` (instead of
   $0), the row's `note` is stamped with `From {city} business-tax rate
   — {basisNote}`, and the toggle's help-text panel switches to the
   matched citation. A `useRef` tracks the last applied suggestion so
   any manual override the founder types in is preserved across
   re-renders; only an unset value or a value that still equals the
   prior suggestion gets re-seeded when the city changes. A parallel
   `lastLocalLicenseNoteRef` clears any previously-stamped citation when
   the curated match is lost so the row never carries stale provenance.

**Founder experience.**
- A DC founder who toggles the row on sees "$300" pre-filled with "From
  Washington business-tax rate" instead of "$0".
- A founder in Boise, Houston, NYC, Chicago, Atlanta, Boston (uncurated
  for this purpose) sees the existing free-text path with help copy that
  is upfront: "Most US cities don't require a general business license
  for a small school — leave this at $0 unless yours does." No
  misleading seed.
- A founder who types "$425" then changes their city in the Profile step
  keeps "$425"; we never overwrite a manual value.

**Why such a small curated table.** Adding more cities was tempting but
risked over-claiming. Each additional entry needs a documentable rate
that genuinely applies to a small school — not a state-wide statute
that happens to mention business licensing in passing. Future additions
should be verified against the city's own published license/fee
schedule and reviewed for school-specific exemptions before being added.

## 4. Validation summary

- Unit: `pnpm --filter @workspace/school-financial-model run test` — 599
  passing, including:
  - 32 cases in `math-trigger-fixes.test.ts` (F1/F2/F3 unit coverage,
    AZ-$70k & WA-$120k hand-checks, CA/DE/FL/TX/NC/WA spot tests, and a
    regex-based notes-vs-amount consistency guard for `STATE_ENTITY_FEES`).
  - 3 cases in `payroll-tax-cap-escalation.test.ts` — engine-level
    integration test that drives `computeBaseFinancials` end-to-end with a
    capped FICA-OASDI scenario at 3% salary escalation and asserts
    Y2/Y1 < 1.03 (regression guard for the F1 outer-multiplier bug).
- Type: `pnpm --filter @workspace/school-financial-model run typecheck` and
  `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run typecheck` — both clean.
- E2E: `pnpm --filter @workspace/school-financial-model run test:e2e` — 19
  passing.
- Engine parity: `scenario-engine-parity.test.ts` continues to pass against
  frozen goldens; no regen needed because the legacy flat-rate path is
  algebraically unchanged: `(annual * rate) * salaryEsc ==
  (annual * salaryEsc) * rate`. Fixtures don't supply
  `payrollTaxComponents`, so they exercise the legacy path.
